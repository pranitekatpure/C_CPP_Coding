2. Order agnosic binary search. 
Problem Statement: 
Given a sorted array of numbers, find if a given number ‘key’ is present in the array. 
We don’t know if it’s sorted in ascending or descending order. 
You should assume that the array can have duplicates.

Write a function to return the index of the ‘key’ if it is present in the array, 
otherwise return -1.

Ex. 1:
Input: [10, 6, 4], key = 10
Output: 0

Ex. 2:
Input: [10, 6, 4], key = 20
Output: -1
